# Turtle-Wars
By using at basic level of python and the "turtle" library, i created competetive and multiplayer game which is everyone can play and have fun. Player 1 can control their character by A and D, Player 2 can control their characher by "left" and "right". If you notice any bug or if you want to some additional things for my game you can let me know. Im waiting your feedbacks. Have fun.
(For the linux and mac systems, i cant find any sound module which work with turtle. Until i find, i make a silence version of the game like a beta version.)
